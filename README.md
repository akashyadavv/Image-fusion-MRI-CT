In this project we are demonstrating image fusion using wavelet transform with
maximum and average rules. Since the input images are CT (computed
tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans of the brain
containing a tumor, we are also showing the tumor. In the arena of biomedical
imaging, two widely used modalities, namely the MRI and the CT scan do not
reveal identically every detail of brain structure. While CT scan is especially
suitable for imaging bone structure and hard tissues, the MR images are much
superior in depicting the soft tissues in the brain that play very important roles
in detecting diseases affecting the skull base. When finally fused together can
conclude many things in the medical field.
